This my first website. In addition, this is my first work made in Visual Studio Code. I was working on it it during 2 hours per day after school, during 5 days.
Among its virtues:
There is built-in console for settings this website. Console can be used before starting the application (the app launch only by console) or in the website on path "/console", it can be used only by admins. You can see how to use it by write in it command "help".
The settings of app are saved in .txt files. It would be better if settings would be processing with library "pandas", but I hadn't enough time to do it.
Besides this there is system by which you can add your language to it. There already are two languages - English and Ukranian. You can explore how it working and add your similar file with name "interface_{your langauge in two symbols}.txt". "template_{country name}.txt" done for more safety of the interface - it's just copy of anoter file, so it doesn't affects on the website.
There are some more "bad things" in my code.  I will fix all of them in my next project (=.
Good luck!
